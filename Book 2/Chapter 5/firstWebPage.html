    <p id="aboutMe"><em>Now this is the Law of the Jungle — as old and as true as the sky;
            And the Wolf that shall keep it may prosper, but the Wolf that shall break it must die.
            As the creeper that girdles the tree-trunk the Law runneth forward and back —
            For the strength of the Pack is the Wolf, and the strength of the Wolf is the Pack.</em></p>
